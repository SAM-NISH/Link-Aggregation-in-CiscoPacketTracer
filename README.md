# Link-Aggregation-in-CiscoPacketTracer
->EtherChannel is a technology that was originally developed by Cisco as a LAN switch-to-switch technique of grouping several Fast or Gigabit Ethernet ports into one 
  logical channel and redundancy without being blocked.
->EtherChannel creates an aggregation that is seen as one logical link.
->There is no need to upgrade the link to a faster and more expensive connection to have more bandwidth.
->In this project we need to configure the ports used in a Switch to create a Etherchannel either staticly(Manually) or by using the LACP or PAgP , hence creating an 
  Aggregated channel or an Etherchannel between 2 switches and hence increasing the efficiency of the existing links between the switches.
